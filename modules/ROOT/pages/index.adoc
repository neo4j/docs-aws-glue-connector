= Neo4j Connector for AWS Glue

Is a JDBC custom connector for AWS Glue that uses the link:https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-jdbc[Neo4j JDBC driver] and a translator module that has been provided to rewrites some SQL queries generated by AWS Glue to be compatible with the expected SQL-support in the JDBC driver.
As Connector for AWS Glue depends on the Neo4j JDBC driver it can benefit from all improvements provided when it has been updated to the latest version of the JDBC driver.

Everything that is doable with the JDBC driver, can also be done within AWS Glue as long as the environment allows it.
The complete documentation of the Neo4j JDBC driver can be found here: link:https://neo4j.com/docs/jdbc-manual/current/[Neo4j JDBC driver documentation]
